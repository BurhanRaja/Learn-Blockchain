# My Blockchain Learnings

## What is Blockchain?

- Blockchain is like a shared database or a ledger that stores transactions. It's a network of computers/servers/nodes working together, making it descentralized.
- Security and decentrality is  the core of blockchain. The purpose of blockchain is to maintain anonimity of a user and keep the transactions publically so no frauds could occur.

## What is Consensus?

- Consesus is a method for coming to agreement over a shared state. It is way by which the network of nodes stay in sync with each other.

## Proof of Work and Proof of Stake (Consensus Mechanism of Blockchain)



## Layers of Blockchain

- `Layer-1` : Layer 1 is the basic fundamental network of blockchain. This layer is the foundation of blockchain based on which the transaction occurs. It is the public ledger. Example :- Ethereum, Bitcoin.
- `Layer-2` : Layer 2 is build on the Layer 1. It is the more advance, easy to use and lightweight version of the Layer 1. It is build to do more advance stuff. Example :- Polygon, Solana.
